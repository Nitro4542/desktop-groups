    <p>Organizes your desktop</p>
</div>

## How do I use it?
Pass a valid desktop group file to the script (and optionally specify a theme file), e.g:

```bash
python -m desktop-groups C:\multimedia.desktopgroup --theme C:\theme.json
```

>[!TIP]
> Create a shortcut on your desktop!

## How do I make my own desktop group file?

The desktopgroup format uses the JSON syntax. Here's how a file could look:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitro4542/desktop-groups/master/src/desktop-groups/desktopgroups.schema.json",
    "group": {
        "name": "my group",
        "icon": "C:\\icon.ico",
        "items": [
            {
                "name": "Command Prompt",
                "icon": "c:\\cmd.ico",
                "command": "cmd"
            },
            {
                "name": "Paint",
                "icon": "c:\\paint.ico",
                "command": "mspaint"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
